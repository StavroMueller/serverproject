Okay, maybe at the end there should be an option at the end to print your map, or export it somehow...
this would be pretty cool.

Okay, you could also edit the way the map is displayed...you can split the path
up into points, and then make kind of a face-away mask to show them the real explorer experience...allowing them to move along and see what they've explored.

Okay, so you could have a point that is passed in to a buffer tool that adds the two resulting clipped rasters

you can clip a something based on a buffer mad from that point - the buffer can be determined by a guy in the crow's nest!
