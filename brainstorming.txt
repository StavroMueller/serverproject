Okay, maybe at the end there should be an option at the end to print your map, or export it somehow...

You can have "special moves" that let you use your vaious crew members as special moves - for example, the crow's nest.

this would be pretty cool.

Okay, you could also edit the way the map is displayed...you can split the path
up into points, and then make kind of a face-away mask to show them the real explorer experience...allowing them to move along and see what they've explored.

Okay, so you could have a point that is passed in to a buffer tool that adds the two resulting clipped rasters

you can clip a something based on a buffer mad from that point - the buffer can be determined by a guy in the crow's nest!

maybe add a thing where there is a basemap where all the places are undefined. wher you are within a certain bounds of the county, it becomes
visible and you can name it. 

hey that's an ideaake a bunch of services where you can just add the layer on demand when you discover it, so you just start out with spain.

There could be a buton that links to a function that adds thst good and sbtracts money like in a store

we can use the distnce calculator to determine hit chances
